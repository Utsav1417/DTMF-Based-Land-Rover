A phone call is to be initiated by the user to the phone connected to the rover. The phone call is then received by the phone on the rover which is basically kept on auto answer mode. Mobile phone is connected to the rover with the help of a 3.5 mm auxiliary port (AUX) cable. Tip and Ring are the two conductors of the auxiliary cable. The tip is connected as a input to the pin 2 i.e. IN+ of the DTMF Decoder IC whereas the ring is grounded. The DTMF decoder IC is connected to the phone by auxiliary port. DTMF keypad is placed out on a 4 cross 4 matrices, in which each row represents a high frequency, with DTMF, each key passed on a phone generates two tones of the specific frequencies from which one tone is generated from a high frequency tone and a low frequency tone. These tones are converted to digital form using DTMF decoder IC MT8870. When any button is pressed, corresponding binary equivalent is generated as per the tone received at Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 i.e. Pin 11, 12, 13 and 14 respectively. For the purpose of increasing the driving capability of the output of the decoder, output pins 11, 12, 13 and 14 of the decoder are connected to the input pins of Arduino 19, 18, 17 and 16 respectively through IC 7404. IC7404 is a NOT gate. It consists of six inverters which perform logical invert action. Hence they invert the output of decoder IC and provide the inverted output as input to the Arduino. Arduino UNO R3 is an open source microcontroller board based on the Microchip ATmega328P microcontroller which is developed by Arduino. Arduino UNO R3 is pre-programmed to provide outputs for given inputs. The Output is taken from the pins 0,1,2,3 and 7 of the Arduino and they are connected to the input pins of Motor driver IC 2,7, 15,10, 1 - 9 respectively. Output is also obtained at the pin 4,5,6 and they can be used for alternate functions. The Motor Driver IC used here is the L293D which is a quadruple high-current half H driver designed to provide bidirectional drive currents of up to 600mA at voltages from 4.5V to 36V. It is designed to provide output for fixed input set of inputs, this set of inputs are provided by Arduino UNO R3. Output pins of Motor driver 3-6 and 11-14 are connected to Motor 1 and Motor 2 respectively. The motor can be rotated in clockwise and anticlockwise direction. It depends upon the tone received by the DTMF decoder i.e. Key pressed by the User. In this way the phone acts a remote.

For eg: When the user press 2 on the cell phone which acts as remote. Following outputs will be available at different stages.
Output of DTMF decoder IC: - Q1 = 0; Q2 = 1; Q3 = 0; Q4 = 0
Output of NOT gate IC: - 1Y = 1; 2Y = 0; 3Y = 1; 4Y = 1
Output of Arduino Uno R3: - 0–8 will provide 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 ( depends on code )
Output of Motor Driver IC will be such that both the motors M1 and M2 will rotate in Clockwise direction i.e. Forward movement.
